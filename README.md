# MarmetoAssess
<p>This small project utilises purely HTML , CSS and JavaScript  for displaying product cards , and is responsive on three different screen sizes as  :
  <br>
Mobile Screen: Up to 767px <br>Tablet Screen: 768px to 1024px<br> Desktop Screen: Above 1025px
</p>
<p>I have used JavaScript's Fetch method to get resources from the url which dynamically updates the products in display , When the user clicks on the "Men," "Women," or "Kids" tab,  the respective product cards are shown and others are hidden. </p>
